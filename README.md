# Coding-Competition
Here are the projects for coding competition!
NOTE: In "Library_Management_System.sln" and "GPA_CGPA_Calculator.sln" files, there are 3 sub files. So, to open and execute them you will need "Visual Studio 2022", which is available free on Microsoft Official Website. After downloading and installing it, you'll need to install an extension with the name like "Desktop Development with C/C++". Make sure to follow above steps to open and exeute files with .sln extension!
